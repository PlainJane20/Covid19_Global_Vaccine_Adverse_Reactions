### Motivation:


### Project Description/Outline:


### Research Questions to Answer:
Track COVID-19 vaccination in the World, answer instantly to your questions:
* Which country is using what vaccine?
* In which country the vaccination programme is more advanced?
* Where are vaccinated more people per day? 
  * But in terms of percent from entire population ?
* Number of unique manufacturers/Vaccines
* What vaccines are used and in which countries?
* What country is vaccinated more people?
* What country is vaccinated a larger percent from its population?
* Peope vaccinated and people fully vaccinated
* Total number of vaccines
* Percent of vaccination
* Daily vaccinations
* Daily vaccinations per million
* People vaccinated (vaccination scheme has 2 vaccines/person, 1st vaccination and 2nd vaccination, after 21 days);
* People vaccination percent
* Which country is using what vaccine or What vaccines are used and in which countries?
* What is the vaccine distribution? Are there any decreases in the number of cases in the countries that begin the vaccination process?
* In which country the vaccination programme is more advanced?
* Where are vaccinated more people per day? But in terms of a percent from the entire population?
* What country is vaccinated more people? What country is vaccinated a larger percentage of its population?
* After the beginning of the vaccine process all around the world, how the infection trend moves?
* Are there any correlations between the factors of development indicators and the numbers of vaccinations?

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1. Pulling data and cleaning the data 
2. Taking the most current data needed for the project
3. Define at what level (ex: Countries, Continent, Manufactors, Patient received doses etc) we want to look 
4. Clean up code and upload to Github
5. Analyze, plot the data to answer our research questions as applicable
6. 
6. PowerPoint slide to present at the end of the project.
