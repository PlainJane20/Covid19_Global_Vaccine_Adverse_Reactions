### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1. Pulling data and cleaning the data 
2. Taking the most current data needed for the project
3. Define at what level (ex: Countries, Continent, Manufactors, Patient received doses etc) we want to look 
4. Clean up code and upload to Github
5. Analyze, plot the data to answer our research questions as applicable
6. 
6. PowerPoint slide to present at the end of the project.

### Data Analytics Team:
* Navi Sohi: Idea, data collection, slides
* Leonard Zhao: Leaflet and plotly
* Paola Lopez: Python Flask
* Yuying Hong: Data cleaning, one extra JS libraryâ†’ animation
